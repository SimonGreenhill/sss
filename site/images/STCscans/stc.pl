<title>Scans of STC</title>
<BODY>
<H1>Electronic <i>Sino-Tibetan: a Conspectus</i> (STC)</H1>
<P>Selections of STC are already a part of the <a href ="stedt.berkeley.edu">STEDT</a> lexical database system. Scanned images of STC will be linked into the Etyma DB via a new ancillary database. Large portions of this text were once scanned and OCRâ€™d, but the resulting data still needs to be manually corrected. This text is incredibly complex typographically, often with enormous, complicated footnotes. STEDT has received permission from Cambridge University Press to reproduce this ground-breaking volume, which is now and would otherwise remain out of print. Sample pages are included below. This web page will be updated as work progresses.</P>
