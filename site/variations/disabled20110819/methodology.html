    <h2>Preparation of sources for etymological analysis</h2>

    <p>Data collection involves literally hundreds of dictionaries,
    wordlists, and solicited questionnaires describing in varying
    levels of detail the lexica of the more than 200 TB languages.
    These data sources vary widely in their age, quality, and
    integrity, and require different processing strategies. A large
    part of the STEDT project involves the integration of these
    sources into the STEDT database.</p>

    <h2>Carrying out etymological analysis</h2>

    <p>Roots, or etyma, are reconstructed according to the
    time-tested principles of the comparative method: searching for
    cognate sets by identifying lexical items with similar
    phonological and semantic shape, working out regular
    correspondences and sound laws, and determining the
    phonological system of the reconstructed proto-language. These
    tasks are necessarily constrained in the case of the STEDT
    project by the unique characteristics of the Sino-Tibetan
    language family.</p>

    <p>PST and PTB were fundamentally monosyllabic, and most of
    their modern descendants remain so today. However, in most ST
    languages compounding has reached an advanced stage, resulting
    in polysyllabic forms in which each syllable is a morpheme with
    a distinct origin. Thus a single word may be associated with
    two or more proto-roots. The goal of the STEDT project is to
    associate each morpheme of every lexical item with a single
    etymon. This means that in many cases a word will appear in
    more than one location in the STEDT volumes, listed under
    <i>each</i> of the roots with which it has been associated.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of etymologies have already been proposed,
    identifying genetically related words in various ST languages.
    These etymologies are not equally plausible or mutually
    consistent. A major task of this project, especially in its
    early stages, has been to sift through the entire corpus of
    etymologies that have been suggested by serious scholars, to
    compare, evaluate and discuss them, and decide which ones to
    retain and which to modify or reject. Scrupulous care has been
    exercised in attributing any given etymology to the scholar who
    first proposed it (either in print or via personal
    communication). Equally important, the large amount of data at
    our disposal has permitted the reconstruction of hundreds of
    new etyma in the semantic area of bodyparts alone.</p>

    <p>Special attention is paid to the patterns of phonological
    variation displayed by each proto-root. As in Indo-European, ST
    etyma are not invariant in shape, but form clusters of
    morphophonemically related sub-roots, which have traditionally
    been referred to as word families. The "allofams" of a word
    family may differ from each other by their prefixes, by the
    voicing or voicelessness of their initial consonant, by their
    nuclear vowel, by their final consonant, and/or by their tone.
    These patterns of variation are not random, but fall into
    certain well-defined classes of phenomena. Great care needs to
    be exercised in attributing particular forms in modern
    languages to the particular proto-allofam from which they
    descend.</p>

    <p><img align="right" src="../images/breathe.gif" /> Semantic
    variation and shifting are just as essential to trace through
    time as phonological evolution. Certain semantic associations
    can be backed up by phonological evidence (cf.
    BREATH(E)/LIFE/LUNG), but others cannot. Diagrammatic
    representations of the patterns of historical semantic
    association in TB/ST are an integral part of STEDT, via
    "metastatic semantic flowcharts", such as the one shown
    here.</p>

    <p>The actual work of etymologization is done using the
    computer tools described on the <a href=
    "http://stedt.berkeley.edu/html/software.html">Database and
    software page</a> . Etymologies are continually revised in the
    light of new data as it becomes available. Extensive notes
    discussing general considerations and the finer points of
    individual etymologies are entered into the database and will
    constitute a vital part of the finished STEDT volumes.</p>
