    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>STEDT is the <i>Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and
    Thesaurus,</i> a linguistics research project at the <a href=
    "http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California at
    Berkeley</a>. It is directed by <a href=
    "Matisoff/index.html">Professor James
    A. Matisoff</a>
    and administered through the <a href=
    "http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/">Linguistics Department</a>.
    Our goal is the publication of an
    etymological dictionary of Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST), the
    ancestor language of the large Sino-Tibetan language family.
    This family includes Chinese, Tibetan, Burmese, and over 200
    other languages spoken in South and Southeast Asia. The project
    was founded in 1987 and has enjoyed the support of the <a href=
    "http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> and the
    <a href="http://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the
    Humanities</a>.</p>

    <h2>Recent Accomplishments</h2>
    
    <p>The first major dissemination of STEDT research came in the
    form of <i><a href=
    "http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/10116.html">A Handbook of
    Proto-Tibeto-Burman: System and Philosophy of Sino-Tibetan
    Reconstruction</a></i>, an introduction to the reconstructed
    phonology and lexicon of Proto-Tibeto-Burman and the
    philosophical underpinnings on which the STEDT project rests.
    This volume (HPTB) included over 1500 reconstructed
    Proto-Tibeto-Burman roots. In the next phase of the project,
    additional STEDT etymologies and data will be published
    systematically, by semantic field, in electronic form.</p>
