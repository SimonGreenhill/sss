    <i>The Eastern Han Chinese Grammaticon</i></h2>

    <p>Richard Cook</p>

    <p>
Number 9 in the STEDT Monograph Series is a high-resolution edition of《說文解字 ‧ 電子版》<i>Shuō Wén Jiě Zì — Diànzǐ Bǎn:
Digital Recension of the Eastern Hàn Chinese Grammaticon</i>, by Richard S. Cook (Doctoral Dissertation, UC Berkeley, Dept. of Linguistics, 2003). This work, the first-ever reconstruction of a complete Shuō Wén (AD 121) Urtext, presents the results of more than a decade of effort directed at elucidating the major findings of the principal 清 Qīng Dynasty commentary edition (段玉裁 Duàn Yùcái, 1815). In four-volumes (2,400 pages), this monograph situates the 19th c. findings firmly in the context of traditional and modern Chinese lexicography, with complete mappings to important lexica, and Old and Middle Chinese readings. <b>Volume 1</b> documents the recension and phonological findings; <b>Volumes 2 &amp; 3</b> contain the concordance data and source mappings; <b>Volume 4</b> (now available for the first time) contains the complete reconstructed Shuō Wén Urtext typeset in Seal Script (vertical text, right-to-left). <i>Each of the four volumes must be ordered separately.</i>

    <i>Proto-Kuki-Chin: A Reconstructed Ancestor of the Kuki-Chin Languages</i></h2>

    <p>Kenneth VanBik</p>

    <p>
Volume 8 in the STEDT Monograph Series presents <i>Proto-Kuki-Chin: A Reconstructed Ancestor of the Kuki-Chin Languages</i>, a revision of Kenneth VanBik’s 2006 doctoral dissertation (Department of Linguistics, UC Berkeley). This book represents a high-water mark in our understanding of the history of the Kuki-Chin branch of Tibeto-Burman. Nearly 1400 reconstructed cognate sets are presented, at various taxonomic levels: Proto-Kuki-Chin, Proto-Central-Chin, Proto-Northern-Chin, and Proto-Maraic. Special attention is paid to the subgrouping of this highly ramified family, based on the patterns of shared phonological innovations which the various languages display.

    <i>A Descriptive Grammar of Daai Chin</i></h2>

    <p>Helga So-Hartmann</p>

    <p>Volume 7 in the STEDT Monograph Series presents <i>A Descriptive Grammar of Daai Chin</i>, Helga So-Hartmann’s 2008 doctoral dissertation (School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London). This is the most detailed and sophisticated grammar of a Chin language to have appeared since Eugénie J.A. Henderson’s classic (1965) study of Tiddim (Northern Chin group). The Daai language is an important member of the Southern Chin group, with about 45,000 speakers. Chin State is in western Myanmar, and the Daai Chin people live in the interior of the Southern Chin Hills in about 160 villages spread out over the four townships Mindat, Kanpetlet, Paletwa and Matupi.)</p>

    <h2><a name="mng6" id="mng6"></a>STEDT Monograph 6:
    <i>Kinship in Southeastern Asia</i></h2>

    <p>Paul K. Benedict</p>

    <p>Volume 6 in the STEDT Monograph Series presents a facsimile edition of the ground-breaking <i>Kinship in Southeastern Asia</i> (1941, doctoral dissertation, Department of Anthropology, Harvard University), by the late Paul K. Benedict (1912-1997). This expansive volume treats kinship terms in Tibeto-Burman (which it divides into Tibetan, Western Sub-Himalayan, Eastern Sub-Himalayan, Lepcha, Miri and northern Assam, Kachin, Nung, Burmese and Lolo, Konyak, Garo and Bodo, Mikir, Meithei, Mru, Kuki, Naga) on the one hand, and Karen and Chinese on the other. "The approach in the present work might be termed the 'direct method', in that each language or language-group is handled as a unit, along with the relevant ethnographic data, and an attempt is made to view the nomenclature as a functional entity with intra-relationships as well as extra-relationships. In this way a succession of patterns is presented rather than a series of disembodied etymologies or disjointed sets of sibling terms, grandparent terms, and the like. The comparative side is not lost sight of, however, and the writer does not shy at historical reconstruction. His approach is based, not on any metaphysic of kinship, but on practical expediency. He simply sees no other way of creating a <i>complete</i> picture of the culturo-linguistic situation with which he is faced. The linguistic material has been made especially full with the same end in mind. It must not be forgotten that kinship terms are, after all, linguistic elements, even though they are often handled more as if they were fish-traps or types of arrow release, and that linguistic coloring is all-important in shaping the semantic associations of any given term."

    <h2><a name="mng5" id="mng5"></a>STEDT Monograph 5:
    <i>Classical Chinese Combinatorics: Derivation of the Book of Changes Hexagram Sequence</i></h2>

    <p>Richard S. Cook</p>

    <p>The first and most enigmatic of the Chinese classics is the <i>Book of Changes</i>, 
    and the reasoning behind its binary hexagram sequence remained an unsolved 
    mystery for some 3,000 years (according to the tradition ascribing it to King Wen of Zhou, 
    d. -11th c.). This <i>Monograph</i> resolves the classical enigma: 
    <a href="http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~rscook/html/writing.html#ccc">Richard Cook</a> provides a 
    comprehensive analysis of the hexagram sequence, showing that its classification of binary 
    sequences demonstrates knowledge of the convergence of certain <i>linear recurrence sequences</i> 
    (LRS; Pingala -5th c.?, Fibonacci 1202) to <i>division in extreme and mean ratio</i> (DEMR, 
    the &ldquo;Golden Section&rdquo; irrational; Pythagoras -6th c.?, Euclid -4th c.). 
    It is shown that the complex hexagram sequence encapsulates a careful and ingenious demonstration 
    of the LRS/DEMR relation, that this knowledge results from general combinatorial analysis, and is 
    reflected in elements emphasized in ancient Chinese and Western mathematical traditions. 
    This copiously illustrated 660-page volume presents a detailed introduction to the classical 
    problem, an overview and in-depth derivation of the solution, an extensive terminological glossary, and computer 
    source code formalizing all aspects of the derivations. The conclusion of this work situates 
    the major findings in larger historical context.</p>

    <h2><a name="mng4" id="mng4"></a>STEDT Monograph 4:
    <i>Southern Lisu Dictionary</i></h2>

    <p>David Bradley</p>

    <p>Lisu is one of the most important and viable Loloish languages, with nearly a
million speakers, but until recently comparative Loloish studies have been
hampered by the lack of a comprehensive dictionary of the language. David
Bradley, who has already done much to clarify the interrelationships among the
Lolo-Burmese languages as a whole, has been working to fill this
lexicographical lacuna for more than a decade. In 1994, he published a concise
257-page dictionary of Northern Lisu. The present work treats the Southern
dialect. The front matter includes an informative introduction about the Lisu
people and their dialectal subdivisions, and a brief sketch of Lisu syntax. The
body of the 346-page <i>Southern Lisu Dictionary</i> is carefully arranged, with
clear glosses for both the lemmata and the subentries, providing intriguing glimpses 
into Lisu culture.</p>

    <h2><a name="mng3" id="mng3"></a>STEDT Monograph 3:
    <i>Phonological Inventories of Tibeto-Burman Languages</i></h2>

    <p>Ju Namkung, Editor</p>

    <p>Contains phonological information on over 150 Tibeto-Burman
    languages and dialects, gathered from numerous published and
    unpublished sources. The monograph has a two-fold purpose. First,
    it will serve as a companion to forthcoming STEDT volumes,
    providing a key to the various transcription systems employed
    in the STEDT database. Second, it can stand on its own as a
    general reference tool which gathers in a single volume 270
    treatments of Tibeto-Burman phonological systems, each
    comprising symbols and their phonetic values, interpretive
    notes, and sources. In addition, the monograph is indexed by
    language and dialect name, by subgroup and by STEDT source
    abbreviation, making it a convenient and invaluable reference
    for the Tibeto-Burman linguist.</p>
