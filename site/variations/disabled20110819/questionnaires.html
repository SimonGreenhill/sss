    <h1>STEDT Questionnaires</h1>

    <p>An important method of obtaining data for the STEDT database
    is through our STEDT questionnaires. The questionnaires are
    blank word lists organized by semantic field corresponding to
    the sections of the STEDT volumes. In 1989 STEDT distributed
    its first questionnaire, on Body Parts, to dozens of
    Tibeto-Burmanists. The data collected from these respondents
    has been invaluable in the preparation of the first volume of
    STEDT. We have now developed questionnaires on Animals and
    Natural Objects. Colleagues with data on Tibeto-Burman
    languages are invited to fill out these questionnaires and
    return them to us. All data received in this way will be
    properly credited to the respondents.</p>

    <p>Other questionnaires are under development at this time.

    both Microsoft Word 5.1 (Mac), and in plain text formats.</p>
