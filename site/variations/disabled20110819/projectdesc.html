    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>The Sino-Tibetan (ST) languages constitute one of the great
    language families of the world. Yet despite the rapid
    development of Sino-Tibetan studies in recent decades, they
    remain poorly understood; indeed, some branches of the family
    are still virtually unstudied. To fill this vacuum in
    historical linguistic research, the STEDT project began in
    August 1987. Funded jointly by the National Endowment for the
    Humanities and the National Science Foundation, it is charged
    with gathering data from both extant published works and the
    growing body of fieldwork and integrating them into a coherent
    whole. The concrete goal of the project is the publication of a
    multi-volume etymological dictionary of the ancestor language,
    Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST), spoken perhaps 6,000 years ago. The
    Dictionary is organized by semantic fields, so it will
    constitute a "thesaurus" of PST.</p>

    <p>To support our research we have created a large computer
    database of the etymological and lexical information. This
    database consists of a lexical file (currently containing over
    376,000 words in about 200 languages and dialects), an etyma
    file (containing over 2500 reconstructed etymological roots),
    and ancillary files containing references to language names,
    bibliographic citations, extensive etymological notes, and
    semantic diagrams.</p>

    <p>At this point, approximately 45,000 morphemes in the lexical
    file have been etymologized into cognate sets. This analyzed
    data forms the core of Volume I of the Dictionary. The
    reconstructed proto-roots will serve as main entries in the
    Dictionary, followed by those words which derive from them in
    the modern ST languages. Along with the Dictionary, electronic
    and hardcopy versions of materials supporting the
    reconstructions have been or eventually will be published,
    including a directory of language names, a compendium of
    phonological inventories, and detailed sound correspondences in
    the form of a "sound law database. " In due course, the entire
    etymological database will also be made available in
    machine-readable form to the scientific community.</p>

    <p>STEDT publications and data are already helping to unravel
    the tangled web of genetic relationships among languages in
    South and Southeast Asia. The results of our research on
    Sino-Tibetan, taken together with ongoing work on the other
    major language families of South and Southeast Asia (Mon-Khmer,
    Austronesian, Tai-Kadai, Hmong-Mien), will decide larger
    questions about the ultimate genetic affiliations (if any)
    existing among them. In addition, it is our hope that one of
    the ultimate benefits of the STEDT project will be to put
    Sino-Tibetan studies on a par with Indo-European in terms of
    its potential contributions to a wide range of general issues
    in historical linguistics. In many ways the problems faced by
    diachronic linguists are similar everywhere. Yet each different
    area of the world has its own typological / cultural /
    historical flavor, and Sino-Tibetan has many unique features
    which will be of interest to the general linguistic public.</p>
