    <p>For one who has abandoned craving and is free from
    grasping,<br />
    who is skilled in etymology and terms, knowing<br />
    the groupings and sequences of letters,<br />
    this is the final birth.<br />
    This one is called<br />
    the Great Being,<br />
    the Great Sage.<br />
