    </div>

          <p>Sino-Tibetan (ST) is one of the largest language families in
    the world, with more first-language speakers than even
    Indo-European. The more than 1.1 billion speakers of Sinitic
    (the Chinese dialects) constitute the world's largest speech
    community. ST includes both the Sinitic and the Tibeto-Burman
    languages. Most scholars in China today take an even broader
    view of ST (called <i>H&agrave;n-Z&agrave;ng</i> in Mandarin),
    including not only these two branches, but Tai (= "Daic") and
    Hmong-Mien (= Miao-Yao) as well. Even taking ST in its narrower
    sense, we are dealing with a highly differentiated language
    family of formidable scope, complexity, and time-depth.
    Tibeto-Burman (TB) comprises hundreds of languages besides
    Tibetan and Burmese, spread over a vast geographical area
    (China, India, the Himalayan region, peninsular SE Asia).</p>

    <h2><a name="homeland" id="homeland">Homeland and time-depth of
    Sino-Tibetan</a></h2>

    <p>The Proto-Sino-Tibetan (PST) homeland seems to have been
    somewhere on the Himalayan plateau, where the great rivers of
    East and Southeast Asia (including the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong,
    Brahmaputra, Salween, and Irrawaddy) have their source. The
    time of hypothetical ST unity, when the Proto-Han (=
    Proto-Chinese) and Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) peoples formed a
    relatively undifferentiated linguistic community, must have
    been at least as remote as the Proto-Indo-European period,
    perhaps around 4000 B.C.</p>

    <p>The TB peoples slowly fanned outward along these river
    valleys, but only in the middle of the first millennium A.D.
    did they penetrate into peninsular Southeast Asia, where
    speakers of Austronesian (= Malayo-Polynesian) and Mon-Khmer
    (Austroasiatic) languages had already established themselves by
    prehistoric times. The Tai peoples began filtering down from
    the north at about the same time as the TB's. The most recent
    arrivals to the area south of China have been the Hmong-Mien
    (Miao-Yao), most of whom still live in China itself.</p>

    <h2><a name="STlx" id="STlx">About Sino-Tibetan
    linguistics</a></h2>

    <p>The field of ST linguistics is only about 50 years old, and
    has been a flourishing object of inquiry for only the past 25.
    Scholars have been trying since the mid-19th century to situate
    Chinese in a wider genetic context. As the relationships
    between Chinese and Tibetan on the one hand, and Tibetan and
    Burmese on the other became obvious, vague notions of an
    "Indo-Chinese" family (Hodgson 1853, Conrady 1896) began to
    crystallize. The term <i>Sino-Tibetan</i> seems to have been
    used first by R. Shafer (1939-41, 1966/67), who conceived of it
    as a tripartite linguistic stock comprising Chinese,
    Tibeto-Burman (TB), and Tai (= "Daic"). Much of the area in
    which TB languages are spoken is still virtually inaccessible
    for linguistic fieldwork, at least by foreign scholars (NE
    India, Burma, Yunnan, Sichuan, Tibet, Laos, Vietnam). Only in
    Thailand and Nepal has vigorous international fieldwork been
    carried on since the 1960's.</p>

    <h2><a name="components" id="components">The components of
    Sino-Tibetan</a></h2>

    <h3><a name="Chinese" id="Chinese">The Chinese
    Component</a></h3>

    <p>By any criterion (number of speakers, antiquity of
    documented written history, cultural significance, influence on
    other languages) Chinese ranks as one of the most important
    languages in the world. Yet the non-alphabetic nature of the
    Chinese writing system has posed unique problems for the
    historical linguist trying to reconstruct the phonology of
    earlier stages of the language, or establish a genetic
    connection between Chinese and other languages.</p>

    <p>The great Swedish Sinologist, Bernhard Karlgren, basing his
    work on the pioneering philological research of 18th and 19th
    c. Chinese scholars, devoted some 35 years to the phonological
    reconstruction of the pronunciation of thousands of Chinese
    characters (Karlgren 1923, 1954, 1957). Karlgren recognized two
    earlier stages of the language: (1) "Ancient Chinese" (now
    usually called <i>Middle Chinese</i> "MC"), spoken during the
    second half of the 1st millennium A.D., and(2) "Archaic
    Chinese" (now usually called <i>Old Chinese</i> "OC"), spoken
    during the early Zhou (= Chou) dynasty at the beginning of the
    first millennium B.C.</p>

    <p>The reconstruction of MC is based mainly on the
    "rhyme-books" produced by contemporary Chinese literati,
    especially the <i>Qie Yun</i> (602 A.D.), wherein each
    character was given a phonetic value by glossing it with 2
    others, the first of which had the same initial consonant as
    the target character, while the second had the same "rhyme"
    (i.e. vowel, final consonant if any, and tone) as the target
    character.</p>

    <p>The tools available for the reconstruction of OC are much
    more indirect and tricky to use: the patterns of rhyming in the
    earliest Zhou texts, especially the <i>Book of Odes (Shi
    Jing)</i>; and the graphological structure of the characters
    themselves, the vast majority of which are constructed of two
    elements, a <i>radical</i> which gives a clue to its meaning,
    and a <i>phonetic</i> which gives a clue to its pronunciation.
    (But no more than a clue: it cannot be assumed that all the
    characters in a given "phonetic series" had exactly the same
    initial and rhyme.)</p>

    <p>Despite the brilliant successes of Karlgren's methods, they
    have certain severe inherent limitations. First of all, the
    phonological system implied by the <i>Qie Yun</i> is
    forbiddingly complex, lending credence to the view that it does
    not represent the speech of any single dialect of the time (not
    even that of the Tang capital, Chang-an), but is rather
    <i>pan-dialectal</i>, noting distinctions made in any dialect
    with which the compilers (who came from various regions, as
    stated explicitly in the Preface) happened to be familiar.
    Secondly, there is no reason to suppose that the MC
    phonological system of the <i>Qie Yun</i> was the exact lineal
    descendant of the OC system deduced from the <i>Shi Jing</i>
    rhymes and the graphic structure of the characters (in the
    sense that, e.g. Modern High German "descends from" Middle High
    and Old High German). Thirdly, certain modern groups of
    dialects, especially the Min dialects of Fujian (= Fukien) and
    adjacent regions in SE China, have undergone distinctive
    phonological developments that are impossible to trace back to
    the presumed MC system of the rhyme-books (see Chang and Chang
    1972; Norman 1974, 1988).</p>

    <p>Despite the ingenuity of Karlgren's successors in patching
    up this or that aspect of his reconstructions -- or perhaps
    because of this very ingenuity -- Chinese historical phonology
    has until recently been in danger of degenerating into a kind
    of scholasticism: endless reinterpretations of the same data.
    For no matter how rich the material on earlier stages of a
    single language may be, one can only go so far by the methods
    of "internal reconstruction". A tripod cannot stand on a single
    leg. For further progress in ST comparative/historical
    linguistics, it is necessary to look well beyond Chinese.</p>

    <h3>The Tibeto-Burman Component</h3>

    <p>The key component of ST, the branch with the most numerous
    and highly differentiated individual languages, is TB. The
    existence of the TB family was posited as early as the 1850's,
    when it was noticed that many words in "Written Tibetan" (WT),
    attested since the 7th c. A.D., appeared cognate to forms in
    "Written Burmese" (WB), attested since the early 12th c. A.D.
    British scholars and colonial administrators in India and Burma
    began to study some of the dozens of little-known "tribal"
    languages of the region that seemed to be genetically related
    to the two great literary languages, Tibetan and Burmese. This
    early work was collected in the monumental <i>Linguistic Survey
    of India</i> [Grierson and Konow 1903-28], three volumes of
    which (<i>Vol. III, Parts 1,2,3</i>) are devoted to wordlists
    and brief texts from TB languages.</p>

    <p>Subsequent sporadic attempts to find cognates between
    Tibetan and Chinese [e.g. Simon 1929] did not get very far, in
    the absence of any serious scheme for the reconstruction of
    Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB). It remained for the eccentric
    American amateur comparativist Robert Shafer to embark on a
    systematic project to assemble all the material then available
    on TB languages, and to venture a division of the family into
    subgroups. Much of this earlier data had been collected by
    colonial administrators or missionaries who had spent years
    living among the people whose languages they studied, and a
    number of the grammars and dictionaries they produced are of
    lasting value. (Fraser; Hanson; Lorrain 1907; Lorrain 1940;
    Lorrain 1951, Mainwaring, Pettigrew, etc.) Shafer was assisted
    in this Depression-era WPA project by a talented junior
    collaborator, Paul K. Benedict, along with a motley team of
    half-trained indigents who spent their time combing through
    dictionaries and wordlists. The results were enshrined in a
    multi-volumed unpublished manuscript (1939-41) called
    <i>Sino-Tibetan Linguistics</i> (see Benedict 1975).</p>

    <p>Shafer went on to publish his great work, <i>Introduction to
    Sino-Tibetan</i> (1966/67), where he included Tai in the ST
    family, and offered a complex and detailed subgrouping of TB
    into "divisions," "sections," "branches," and "units". Despite
    the illusory nature of this precision, given the inadequate
    quality of the data then available for the various subgroups of
    TB, Shafer's classificatory schema has been adopted
    unquestioningly by many non-specialists.</p>

    <p>Benedict, basing his work on the same data-base as Shafer,
    arrived at different conclusions. In an unpublished manuscript
    entitled <i>Sino-Tibetan: a Conspectus</i> (ca. 1941), he first
    of all banished the Tai languages from ST, leaving only Chinese
    on the one hand, and TB on the other. As for the internal
    subgrouping of TB, though Benedict generally followed Shafer in
    setting up 8 major TB "nuclei", he refrained from trying to
    relate these by family-trees or <i>Stammb&auml;ume</i> of the
    traditional type, preferring to stress that many TB languages
    had so far resisted precise classification, and that the
    subgroups which could safely be established seemed to
    interrelate in ways too complex for a simple tree-diagram.</p>

    <p>When a revised and heavily annotated version of the
    Conspectus (henceforth <i>STC</i>) was finally published in
    1972 with J. Matisoff as contributing editor, this agnostic
    view of the internal structure of TB was retained, with most of
    the family pictured as "radiating out" of the geographically
    central Kachin (= Jinghpaw = Jingpho) language of N. Burma, and
    the Karen languages singled out as being furthest away from
    this central nucleus.</p>

    <p><i>STC</i> offers close to 500 TB etymologies, as well as
    over 300 suggested cognates between PTB and Old Chinese. In
    spite of its shortcomings, its publication ushered in the
    modern era of ST studies, and has become recognized as the
    point of departure for future work in the field.</p>

    <h2><a name="TBlg" id="TBlg">Tibeto-Burman languages and their
    subgrouping</a></h2>

    <p>Though the total number of TB speakers is only about 56
    million, smaller than for Tai-Kadai or Mon-Khmer/
    Austroasiatic, the number of individual TB languages is the
    largest of any family in E/SE Asia. The relatively low overall
    total for TB is the fact that its most populous language,
    Burmese, only has about 22 million speakers, while the number
    of Thai (45.5 million) and Vietnamese (55.4 million) speakers
    has increased rapidly in recent decades.</p>

    <h3><a name="names" id="names">Language names</a></h3>

    <p>Of the more than 1400 TB language names I have collected
    (Matisoff 1986), many are only multiple designations for the
    same language or dialect, Any given language is likely to be
    known by several different names: its autonym (what the people
    call themselves), and perhaps several exonyms (what other
    groups call them). Some of the latter may be loconyms (e.g. the
    name of a conspicuous village where the language is spoken, or
    of a nearby river). Thus, the 20,000 speakers of a certain
    language of Nagaland call themselves and their language Memi
    (and used to call themselves Imemai), but they and their
    language are now known to outsiders either as Mao, or as
    Sopvoma (the name of their principal village). The 40,000
    speakers of Lotha Naga are called Chizima, Choimi, and Miklai
    by the neighboring Angami, Sema, and Assamese, respectively.
    Conversely, quite different languages are often called by the
    same or very similar names: Nung is both a Central Tai language
    and a Tibeto-Burman language of the Nungish group; Mru is a TB
    language of the Kuki-Chin group, but Maru, also TB, belongs to
    the Burmish group; Kham(s) is both a dialect of Tibetan and a
    separate language of central Nepal.</p>

    <p>Old names (paleonyms) now felt to be pejorative are rapidly
    being replaced by new ones (neonyms). We are now, e.g.,
    expected to say Yi, Mizo, Adi, Nishi, Karbi (instead of Lolo,
    Lushai, Abor, Dafla, and Mikir, respectively), even though
    these older terms have been enshrined in the Western literature
    on TB languages for a century. Nomenclatural proliferation
    continues apace, perhaps at a faster rate than ever before. It
    has recently been proposed to differentiate among approximately
    25 Yi (Loloish) dialects of China by using the pronunciations
    of the vowels in their common autonym, e.g. Nasu, Nosu, Nusu,
    Neuseu, Nesu, Naso, etc. (Chen Kang, p.c. 1988).</p>

    <p>A further complication is the fact that many language names
    are used in both a narrower and a broader sense, sometimes
    referring to one specific language, but often to a whole group
    of linguistically or culturally related languages. Often very
    small or vulnerable groups will call themselves by the name of
    a somewhat larger or more prestigious neighbor, often
    hesitating to reveal their true ethnicity to outsiders. The
    tiny Anal people, an "Old Kukish" group of 6600 speakers in
    Burma and Bangladesh, "declared themselves to be Nagas in 1963"
    (Marrison 1967, p. 379). There is even a trend in Nagaland to
    artificially create larger linguistic/ethnic groups by
    combining syllables of several individual names, e.g.
    Chakhesang (from Chokri, Khezha, and Sangtam) and Zeliang (from
    Zemi and Liangmai).</p>

    <p>With all this in mind, my best estimate is that the TB
    family contains at least 250 separate languages, which may be
    broken down into population categories as shown below. For
    about half of the languages in category (8), accurate
    population figures are not available, andsome of them may be in
    danger of extinction.</p>

    <h3><a name="subgroup" id="subgroup">Subgrouping of
    Tibeto-Burman</a></h3>

    <p>The most extensive account of the problems involved in
    attempting to subgroup TB in the light of our present knowledge
    is Matisoff 1978. As a working hypothesis, I have modified the
    unwieldy model presented in Benedict 1972 in several respects.
    For the new TB family tree that I propose as a heuristic model
    is above.</p>

    <h4><a name="Kamarupan" id="Kamarupan">Kamarupan</a></h4>

    <p>Benedict's Kuki-Chin-Naga, Abor-Miri-Dafla, and Bodo-Garo
    subgroups, spoken in NE India and adjacent regions of Burma,
    are lumped together under the purely geographical rubric of
    Kamarupan (from Kamarupa, the Sanskrit term for Assam). These
    languages constitute the center of diversification of the whole
    TB family. Nagaland alone, with an area of only 6350 sq. mi.,
    is home to some 90 Tibeto-Burman languages and dialects. With a
    few exceptions, e.g. Lushai (Lorrain 1940), Tangkhul Naga
    (Pettigrew 1918, Bhat 1969), Garo (Burling 1961), Tiddim Chin
    (Henderson 1965), Bawm (Schwerli 1979), these "Indospheric" TB
    languages have been poorly recorded until recently, and many
    are still hardly known at all.</p>

    <p>Recent research is revealing how interesting, diversified,
    and important these languages are. An invaluable compendium of
    older data on the Naga languages is Marrison 1967, a source
    which was extensively utilized in the comparative study of the
    Northern Naga subgroup by W. French (1983). A. Weidert (1987)
    is a sophisticated and data-packed study of the phonology of
    Kamarupan languages, marred only by its disorganized
    presentation and over-formalistic approach. New raw material on
    Kamarupan languages is becoming increasingly available in the
    publications of the Linguistic Circle of Nagaland (Kohima) and
    the Central Institute of Indian Languages (Mysore), and through
    the efforts of energetic scholar-administrators like K. Das
    Gupta in Arunachal Pradesh [see Das Gupta 1963, 1968, 1971].
    Yet a great deal of work remains to be done in this area of TB,
    and it would be unrealistic to attempt a precise subgrouping of
    Kamarupan at the moment, i.e. a clarification of the
    higher-order relationships of the subgroups traditionally
    designated as Kuki-Chin-Naga, Bodo-Garo (= Barish), and
    Abor-Miri-Dafla (= Mirish). Several important languages seem to
    fall outside any of these groups, e.g. Mikir (Gr&uuml;ssner
    1978, Walker 1925), Meithei (Thoudam 1980), and Mru
    (L&ouml;ffler 1966). Of all these languages, the Mirish ones
    seem most lexically aberrant from the viewpoint of TB in
    general, even in its numerals (JAM 1995).</p>

    <h4><a name="Qiangic" id="Qiangic">Qiangic</a></h4>

    <p>The most exciting recent development in TB studies is the
    discovery of a new branch of the family, hitherto virtually
    unknown to Western scholars. These are the Qiangic languages of
    Sichuan. Extensive lexical and grammatical material has been
    collected on a dozen languages of the Qiangic group (Lu Shaozun
    1980; Sun 1981, 1985, 1990). Besides Qiang, other languages in
    the group include Baima, Ergong, Ersu/Tosu, Gyarong (=
    rGyarong), Guiqiong, Muya, Namuyi, Pumi, Shixing, Zhaba.
    Ersu/Tosu is perhaps an indirect descendant of the extinct
    Xixia (=Hsi-hsia=Tangut) language, spoken in a once-powerful
    empire in the Tibetan-Chinese-Uighur border regions, finally
    destroyed by the Mongols in the 13th c. A large literature in
    Xixia survives, in a logographic writing system invented in the
    11th c., with thousands of intricate characters inspired by,
    but graphically independent of Chinese, the decipherment of
    which is now well-advanced by Japanese and Russian scholars
    (Nishida 1964/66, Sofronov 1968). It was thought at first that
    Xixia was a Loloish language, but it now seems more likely that
    it belongs to the Qiangic group.</p>

    <p>From the limited data so far made available, the Qiangic
    languages are of unusual interest, both synchronically and
    diachronically. They are characterized by initial consonant
    clusters comparable in complexity to those of Written Tibetan.
    Many of these are clearly secondary, resulting from the
    reduction of disyllabic compounds (see 7.3 below). Some
    languages of the group are tonal, while others are not,
    providing an ideal terrain for the investigation of the
    mechanisms of tonogenesis.</p>

    <h4><a name="Himalayish" id="Himalayish">Himalayish</a></h4>

    <p>Himalayish comprises such relatively well-known languages as
    Tibetan, Lepcha (Sikkim; see Mainwaring), and Newari (spoken in
    the Kathmandu valley of Nepal; see Malla 1984, Genetti 1990),
    as well as dozens of others, some on the verge of extinction.
    Progress has been particularly impressive in the study of the
    TB languages of Nepal, especially those of the
    Tamang-Gurung-Thakali-Manang group (Mazaudon 1971, 1978;
    Glover); Kham-Magar (Watters 1975, 1985); Chepang (Caughley);
    Sunwar (Genetti); and the "Rai" or "Kiranti" languages of E.
    Nepal, which are generally characterized by complex
    inflectional morphology. (Allen 1975, Michailovsky 1981, Winter
    1985, van Driem 1987, 1991). The westernmost languages in the
    TB family, e.g. Pattani (= Manchati), belong to the Himalayish
    group, and are beginning to be studied by Indian scholars
    (Sharma 1982).</p>

    <p>Himalayish languages generally preserve prefixes and initial
    clusters well, along with final <i>-s, -r,</i> and <i>-l</i>.
    Written Tibetan is consonantally the most archaic attested TB
    language, preserving e.g. initial clusters that had disappeared
    from Chinese a millennium before.</p>

    <h4><a name="Kachinic" id="Kachinic">Kachinic</a></h4>

    <p>Kachinic, like Karenic, is relatively undifferentiated,
    consisting basically of a single language and its dialects.
    Kachin (= Jingpho), spoken in northernmost Burma and adjacent
    parts of China and India, is well known, thanks to Hanson's
    dictionary (1906/1954), its (unpublished) revision by Maran,
    and recent work by Chinese scholars (1981, 1983). The name
    "Kachin" is also used loosely for various Burmish groups of N.
    Burma (Atsi, Lashi, Maru). Since Kachinic shows phonological
    and lexical similarities with several other branches of TB
    (Kamarupan, Himalayish, Lolo-Burmese [Matisoff 1974]), it has
    been considered to be genetically central in the TB family,
    just as it is geographically central (STC, p.6; Burling 1971).
    The Nungish languages (Lo 1945, Sun 1982, LaPolla 1986) seem
    closest to Kachinic, though it is too early to tell whether
    they also have a special relationship to the Qiangic group.</p>

    <h4><a name="Lolo-Burmese" id=
    "Lolo-Burmese">Lolo-Burmese</a></h4>

    <p>Burmese, attested since the 7th c. A.D., is one of the
    best-known TB languages. (Good modern grammars are Okell 1969,
    Wheatley 1982.) The languages of the N. Loloish subgroup
    (called "Yi" in China) are firmly within the "Sinosphere", and
    many of them have been well recorded by Chinese scholars (Fu
    1950; Gao 1955, 1958; Ma 1951, 1958; Yuan 1953)The Central and
    Southern Loloish languages are spoken as far south as Thailand
    and Laos, where Western and Japanese scholars have had access
    to them since the 1960's (see Hope 1974; Lewis 1968; Srinuan
    1976; Nishida 1966/67). More detailed comparative-historical
    work has been done on Loloish than on any other branch of TB
    (Bradley 1978; Burling 1967; Hansson 1989; Matisoff 1968, 1970,
    1972a, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1979, 1991; Nishida 1966/67; Thurgood
    1981; Wheatley 1973).</p>

    <p>Loloish has strictly monosyllabic morphemes, few initial
    clusters or final consonants, often complex tone-systems, and a
    penchant for compounding as its chief morphological device. The
    Loloish language with the most speakers and greatest dialectal
    differentiation is Lolo (Yi) itself, with 5 million speakers in
    Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangxi, and a syllabic writing system of
    considerable antiquity (Ma: Cuanwen Congke). The tribal TB
    language that has been studied in greatest detail is Lahu
    (Central Loloish) (Bradley "Lahu dialects"; Matisoff 1969a,
    1969b, 1972b, 1973/82, 1976, 1988, 1989, 1991). The Naxi/Moso
    language is close to the Loloish nucleus, and is of special
    interest because of its complex, hieroglyphic-like writing
    system (see Okrand 1974; Rock 1963; Matisoff 1972 [TSR],
    "Jiburish").</p>

    <h4><a name="Karenic" id="Karenic">Karenic</a></h4>

    <p>In my view the Karenic group of the Thai-Burmese borderlands
    should be considered as just another subgroup of TB, and need
    not be singled out as having split off from the rest of the
    family at an especially early date. The argument for the
    special status of Karen is mostly syntactic. Alone of all TB
    languages (except for the heavily Sinicized Bai), Karen has its
    objects coming after its verbs. Now that we realize that
    syntactic change can easily occur (either for language-internal
    reasons or as the result of close contact with other
    languages), this is a less persuasive criterion for genetic
    classification. Karen has been under heavy influence from Mon
    and Thai (both SVO languages). Atendency for the rightward
    "hopping over the verb" of certain nominal arguments
    (especially locative NP's) has also been pointed out for N.
    Loloish languages under Chinese influence (Wheatley 1982), yet
    there is no reason at all not to consider them to belong to "TB
    proper."</p>

    <p>The Karen languages are only beginning to receive the
    attention they deserve. The early comparative work of R. B.
    Jones (1961) requires fundamental revision in the light of
    Haudricourt's contributions (1946, 1975). The publication of
    research now in progress (e.g. E. J. A. Henderson's dictionary
    of Bwe Karen and D. Solnit's grammar of Eastern Kayah Karen)
    will dramatically improve our knowledge of this key branch of
    TB.</p>
