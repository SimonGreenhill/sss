    <h2>The database</h2>

    <p>In order to store and analyze the large quantities of data
    involved in the STEDT project, we have developed a large
    relational database and a number of software tools to manage
    it.</p>

    <p>The database consists of a lexical file, an etyma file, a
    language file, a source bibliography file, and a number of
    linking files relating them. Lexical data has been loaded into
    the database from hundreds of Sino-Tibetan languages.
    Data-sources range from published dictionaries and wordlists to
    questionnaires solicited from field researchers. Most of the
    data is entered manually into the computer by STEDT personnel,
    and is loaded into the lexical file after extensive
    proofreading. A small amount of data made available to us on
    computer disk can be loaded directly.</p>

    <p>The etyma file now contains over 1,900 proposed roots at all
    levels of reconstruction, from PST and PTB down to parent
    languages of individual branches. The vast majority of these
    roots are new, in that they have been discovered at the STEDT
    project or are refinements of previously posited etyma.</p>

    <h2>"Tagger's Assistant"</h2>

    <p>Several software tools have been developed to address the
    problem of analyzing and etymologizing the vast amounts of data
    in the STEDT database. The most important of these tools is the
    "Tagger's Assistant".</p>

    <p>In STEDT parlance, to "tag" is to associate a lexical record
    with the root from which it isdeemed to descend.The "Tagger's
    Assistant" is a small FoxPro program that accesses the database
    for purposes of etymologization. Using Tagger's Assistant, it
    is possible to tag etyma directly in the lexicon file,
    facilitating the etymologization process.</p>

    <p>The Tagger's Assistant provides numerous views of the
    lexical records and facilitates the grouping and searching of
    records by various criteria, such as by gloss, phonological
    shape, original data source or language.In the view of the
    lexical data file shown here, records are dispalyed in order by
    the GLOSS field.</p>

    <p>The Tagger's Assistant shortcuts the tedious steps normally
    associated with using FoxPro by providing a point-and-click
    interface to common database functions (shown below).The
    computer software does not make any decisions about
    etymologization; it simply provides an environment in which the
    work of etymologizing can be carried out with speed,
    efficiency, and accuracy.</p>

    <h2>STEDT font</h2>

    <p>In order to accommodate all the orthographies of our source
    transcriptions, a special font was developed in the early years
    of the project. Known as the STEDT font, it includes the
    letters of the Roman alphabet, a large number of IPA and other
    phonetic symbols, and various symbols and diacritics found in
    sources on East and Southeast Asian languages. This font is
    available for downloading from our <a href=
